The nail hoard was discovered in 1960 in a four-metre-deep pit covered by two metres of gravel.\\n\\nWhy had the Romans buried a million nails? The likely explanation is that the withdrawal was rushed, and they didn't want the local Caledonians getting their hands on 10 tons of weapons grade iron. The Romans buried the nails so deep that they would not be discovered for almost two millennia.\\n\\nLater civilizations would value the skilled blacksmith's labour in a nail even more than the raw material. As Roma Agrawal explains in her new delightful book Nuts and Bolts, early 17th-century Virginians would sometimes burn down their homes if they were planning to relocate. This was an attempt to recover the valuable nails, which could be reused after sifting the ashes. The idea that one might burn down an entire house just to reclaim the nails underlines how scarce, costly and valuable the simple-seeming technology was.\\n\\nThe price of nails fell by 90% between the late 1700s and mid-1900s, as economist Daniel Sichel points out in a research paper. According to Sichel, although the falling price of nails was driven partly by cheaper iron and cheaper energy, most of the credit goes to nail manufacturers who simply found more efficient ways to turn steel into nails.\\n\\nNails themselves have changed over the years, but Sichel studied them because they haven't changed much. Roman lamps and Roman chariots are very different from LED strips and sports cars, but Roman nails are still clearly nails. It would be absurd to try to track the changing price of sports cars since 1695, but to ask the same question of nails makes perfect sense.\\n\\nI make no apology for being obsessed by a particular feature of everyday objects: their price. I am an economist, after all. After writing two books about the history of inventions, one thing I've learnt is that while it is the enchantingly sophisticated technologies that get all the hype, it's the cheap technologies that change the world.\\n\\nThe Gutenberg printing press transformed civilisation not by changing the nature of writing but by changing its cost - and it would have achieved little without a parallel collapse in the price of surfaces to write on, thanks to an overlooked technology called paper. Solar panels had a few niche uses until they became cheap; now they are transforming the global energy system.\"\n      },\n      \"questionAnalyses\": [\n        {\n          \"questionNumber\": 21,\n          \"analysisSteps\": {\n            \"questionTypeIdentification\": {\n              \"questionType\": \"细节题 - 因果细节题\",\n              \"locateWord\": \"Romans buried the nails\",\n              \"locateSentence\": \"Why had the Romans buried a million nails?

The idea is based on studies of communities such as the !Kung of Botswana, where each child is cared for by many adults. !Kung children as young as four will help to look after younger ones and 'baby-wearing', in which infants are carried in slings, is considered the norm.\\n\\n According to Dr Nikhil Chaudhary, an evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University, these practices, known as alloparenting, could lead to less anxiety for children and parents.\\n\\nDr Annie Swanepoel, a child psychiatrist, believes that there are ways to incorporate them into western life. In Germany, one scheme has paired an old people's home with a nursery. The residents help to look after the children, an arrangement akin to alloparenting. Another measure could be encouraging friendships between children in different school years to mimic the supervised mixed-age play groups in hunter-gatherer communities.\\n\\nIn a paper published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, researchers said that the western nuclear family was a recent invention which broke with evolutionary history. This abrupt shift to an 'intensive mothering narrative' which suggests that mothers should manage child care alone, was likely to have been harmful. 'Such narratives can lead to maternal exhaustion and have dangerous consequences,' they wrote.\\n\\nBy contrast, in hunter-gatherer societies adults other than the parents can provide almost half of a child's care. One previous study looked at the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It found that infants had an average of 14 alloparents a day by the time they were 18 weeks old and were passed between care givers eight times an hour.\\n\\nChaudhary said that parents now had less child care support from family and social networks than during most of human evolutionary history, but introducing additional caregivers could reduce stress and maternal depression, which could have a 'knock-on' benefit to child's wellbeing. An infant born to a hunter-gatherer society could have more than ten caregivers - this contrasts starkly to nursery settings in the UK where regulations call for a ratio of one carer to four children aged two to three.\\n\\nWhile hunter-gatherer children learn from observation and imitation in mixed-age playgroups, researchers said that western 'instructive teaching', where pupils are asked to sit still, may contribute to conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Chaudhary said that Britain should explore the possibility that older siblings helping their parents might also enhance their own social development.\"\n      },\n      \"questionAnalyses\": [\n        {\n          \"questionNumber\": 26,\n          \"analysisSteps\": {\n            \"questionTypeIdentification\": {\n              \"questionType\": \"词句理解题\",\n              \"locateWord\": \"alloparenting\",\n              \"locateSentence\": \"According to Dr Nikhil Chaudhary, an evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University, these practices, known as alloparenting, could lead to less anxiety for children and parents.\",\n              \"explanation\": \"这是一道词句理解题。题干询问'alloparenting refers to the practice of'，直接询问'alloparenting'这个概念的具体含义。'alloparenting'在原文中有明确提及，需要根据上下文来理解其具体指代内容。\",\n              \"knowledgeTag\": \"4.1 阅读题型识别 - 词句理解题\"\n            },\n            \"keySentenceIdentification\": {\n              \"keySentence\": \"The idea is based on studies of communities such as the !Kung of Botswana, where each child is cared for by many adults. !Kung children as young as four will help to look after younger ones and 'baby-wearing', in which infants are carried in slings, is considered the norm.\",\n              \"explanation\": \"词句理解题的关键句通常在被询问词句的前后句中。'alloparenting'出现在第二段，但其具体含义在第一段已经详细描述。第一段描述了!Kung社区的育儿方式：'each child is cared for by many adults'（每个孩子都由许多成年人照顾），以及'!Kung children as young as four will help to look after younger ones'（年仅四岁的!Kung儿童会帮忙照顾更小的孩子）。这些描述正是'alloparenting'概念的具体体现。第二段中'these practices, known as alloparenting'里的'these practices'指代的就是第一段描述的这些做法。\",\n              \"knowledgeTag\": [\n                \"4.2 定位及解题技巧 - 词句理解题关键句定位\",\n                \"4.3 辅助技巧 - 同义改写原则\"\n              ]\n            },\n            \"understandingKeySentence\": {\n              \"translation\": \"这一想法基于对诸如博茨瓦纳!Kung等社区的研究，在那里每个孩子都由许多成年人照顾。年仅四岁的!Kung儿童会帮忙照顾更小的孩子，'婴儿佩戴'（用吊带背着婴儿）被认为是常态。\"\n            },\n            \"correctOptionAnalysis\": {\n              \"correctOption\": \"A\",\n              \"explanation\": \"正确答案是A 'sharing childcare among community members'（在社区成员之间分享育儿工作）。关键句明确描述了alloparenting的核心特征：'each child is cared for by many adults'（每个孩子都由许多成年人照顾）。这里的同义替换关系为：'many adults'（许多成年人）= 'community members'（社区成员）；'cared for by'（被照顾）= 'sharing childcare'（分享育儿）。原文强调的是育儿责任在社区中的共同承担，而不是单独由父母负责，这正是选项A所表达的含义。\",\n              \"knowledgeTag\": \"4.2 定位及解题技巧 - 词句理解题关键句定位\"\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"questionNumber\": 27,\n          \"analysisSteps\": {\n            \"questionTypeIdentification\": {\n              \"questionType\": \"例证题\",\n              \"locateWord\": \"scheme in Germany\",\n              \"locateSentence\": \"In Germany, one scheme has paired an old people's home with a nursery.
